          "answer": "Our credit system allows you to book classes and sessions at various fitness and wellness venues. Each activity costs a certain number of credits based on factors like class type, location, popularity, and time slot. You receive a set number of credits each month based on your subscription plan, and you can use them however you prefer."
        },
        "cancelSubscription": {
          "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time with no cancellation fees. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period, and you won't be charged again after that. You can easily manage your subscription from your account settings."
        },
        "creditsExpire": {
          "question": "Do unused credits expire?",
          "answer": "Credits roll over for a limited time depending on your plan: Basic plan credits roll over for up to 2 months, Plus plan for up to 3 months, and Premium plan for up to 4 months. After that period, unused credits will expire. This policy encourages regular activity while still giving you flexibility."
        },
        "changePlan": {
          "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time from your account settings. If you upgrade, the change takes effect immediately, and you'll be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you downgrade, the change will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle."
        },
        "bookClass": {
          "question": "How do I book a class?",
          "answer": "You can book classes through our website or mobile app. Simply browse available classes by location, activity type, or time, and reserve your spot using your available credits. You can book classes up to a week in advance, and you'll receive a confirmation email with all the details after booking."
        },
        "cancellationPolicy": {
          "question": "What is the cancellation policy for booked classes?",
          "answer": "You can cancel a booked class up to 12 hours before the scheduled start time to receive a full credit refund. Cancellations made less than 12 hours in advance will not be refunded. This policy helps ensure that spots remain available for other members and that our partner studios can plan accordingly."
        },
        "additionalFees": {
          "question": "Are there any additional fees beyond the subscription?",
          "answer": "No, there are no hidden fees. Your monthly subscription covers all the credits you need to book classes. Some premium or special events might require additional credits, but these will be clearly marked, and you'll always see the credit cost before booking."
        },
        "shareCredits": {
          "question": "Can I share my credits with friends or family?",
          "answer": "Premium plan members can share up to 20 credits per month with friends or family. Basic and Plus plan members cannot share credits, but they can purchase gift cards or invite friends using our referral program to earn bonus credits."
